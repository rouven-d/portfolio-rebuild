            Hey there! I’m Rouven and I’m into web development, design and
            especially enthusiastic about the Web 3.0. I graduated with a
            Masters in International Business from RMIT University in 2019 and
            have since then worked in project management roles. I am
            continuously building up my digital skillset on the MERN stack. Fun
            fact about me: I lived in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam for two years.{" "}
